# 3D-Bezier-patch-ARM-NEON-Assembly
A 3D Bezier creator in full ARM NEON Assembly


In 1987 I started programming Assembly language on the first ARM Processor and its first OS
The ARM2 with the Arthur OS, later to be called RISCOS
My motivation to start learning Assembly language was initiated by a frustration to be stuck with a very slow filled triangle command in BASIC. It took me weeks to understand and finish, but the result eventually was 70 times faster. I fell in love with the architecture and the extremely clever setup.
