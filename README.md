# 3D-Bezier-patch-ARM-NEON-Assembly
A 3D Bezier creator in full ARM NEON Assembly


In 1987 I started programming Assembly language on the first ARM Processor and its first OS,
The ARM2 with the Arthur OS, later to be called RISCOS

My motivation to start learning Assembly language was initiated by a frustration to be stuck with a very slow triangle fill command in BASIC. It took me weeks to understand and finish the assembly algorithm, but the result eventually was 70 times faster. I fell in love with the architecture and the extremely clever setup.
In 1991 I quit programming as a hobby as I was starting my carreer in the army and later at airports. Only a few years ago, when the RaspBerry Pi was launched, together with the original RISCOS, I bought one and was immediately ready to go.
I set my challenge to learn the NEON instruction set and create the fastest possible 3D-patch modeller. Always been interested in curved surfaces....
